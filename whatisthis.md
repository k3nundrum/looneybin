fun linked in bot i mangled together based on a pythonforpentesting udemy course to automate checking out job postings relevant to your career or interests. Logic here being that if I go and visit a posting...the job poster will see that my profile has visited the post....then they will click on my profile, learn more about me organically on their own and then hopefully reach out to me instead of the other way around.
